# Java-List-Comparison-Demo
This is the code used for my Target "beginnerCon" presentation: "[Comparing Java Lists The Right Way (Java Focus)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ep0l3kNxX44GhcpOByriEVcEpNakMFAaMj5geQb-siM/edit?usp=sharing)". 


The point is to observe performance against different list comparison styles. 

Object creation is handled in the service, comparisons are handled in the processor, and main() is in Application.java. 
You can email me at schaum@wisc.edu for any questions, comments, or corrections.
